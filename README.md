Provide the client with a codebase that is easier to read and accessible to everyone. **accessibility** ensures that people with disabilities can access a website using assistive technologies such as screen readers, and braille keyboards. A website that more accessible is more compatible for SEO purposes.


## Description

This project is a comprehensive refactoring effort aimed at enhancing accessibility to optimize the client's website, making it more compatible with SEO standards. The primary objective is to transition from generic `<div>` elements to semantic HTML elements, aligning the code with modern accessibility standards. This strategic approach not only improves the website's overall accessibility but also ensures a well-structured and search engine-friendly codebase. In addition, the project involves the consolidation of CSS properties with similar functionalities, promoting codebase efficiency and further contributing to the site's SEO compatibility. The outcome is a refined and future-proofed codebase that not only meets current standards but also positions the client's website for optimal visibility and performance in search engine results.
